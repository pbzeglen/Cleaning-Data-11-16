# Code Book

## Subject and Action
There are thirty subjects, with an integer from 1 to 30 assigned to them as an identifier. 
There are six actions: "WALKING","WALKING_UPSTAIRS","WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","SITTING","STANDING","LAYING". 
The action column of the tidy dataset is labeled with these actions. The subject column displays each subjects number id.

## Time vs. Fast fourier transform

The entire dataset is based on these measurements: 
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

"Acc" indicates acceleration (m/s^2), "mag" indicates the "magnitude" of the movement (m/s), 
Gyro indicates the raw "gyroscopic rotation data" from the phone, and Jerk represents the change in calculated changes in acceleration (m/s^3).
The prefaces "t" and "f" represented the type of transform on the data: "t" for "time domain" and "f" for "fast fourier transform". 
In the updated codebook, the variables have been changed to their longer name for readability.

## Mean vs. Standard Deviation

The standard deviation of each variable was calculated in each axis direction and a standard deviation measurement is 
indicated by "std()" at the end of the column label. The mean on each axis was also calculated and is represented by "mean()".
